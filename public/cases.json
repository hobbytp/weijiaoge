        "description": "\n    **1. Bollywood-retro Look**\n    **Prompt:**\n    Create a full-length photorealistic image of the uploaded person as a 1970s Bollywood superstar. Scene: outside a Mumbai cinema hall during a film premiere, marquee glowing in neon, vintage Bollywood posters on the walls. The subject is styled in Western-inspired Bollywood glamour of the 1970s, a shimmering sequined evening gown or satin jumpsuit with flared bottoms, a feather boa or faux fur stole draped over the shoulders, and platform heels. Accessories include oversized tinted sunglasses, chunky jewellery, and a clutch bag. Hair styled in voluminous waves or a glamorous blow-dry, with bold eyeliner and glossy lipstick completing the look. Surround them with flashing cameras, paparazzi holding vintage film cameras, and a crowd of fans reaching out for autographs. Add authentic 1970s colour grading (warm tones, film grain, cinematic contrast). Capture the aura of a confident, glamorous star making a grand entrance – charismatic, stylish, and larger-than-life.\n\n    **2. Moody Studio Portrait**\n    **Prompt:**\n    This is a photo of me.

The background should show the iconic monument with soft bokeh, creating a romantic, cinematic atmosphere with deep shadows and golden highlights.\n\n    **4. The Vintage Gentleman**\n    **Prompt:**\n    Transform this photo into a sophisticated vintage gentleman portrait. The person should be wearing a tailored three-piece suit from the 1970s era, complete with wide lapels, a patterned tie, and polished leather shoes. The setting should be a classic library or study with warm wood tones, vintage books, and soft natural lighting. Add subtle film grain and warm color grading to enhance the retro aesthetic.\n\n    **5. The Serene Sunset Look**\n    **Prompt:**\n    Create a softly lit portrait of the uploaded person standing indoors near a window with warm sunlight streaming through. Use a cinematic, golden-hour lighting style that highlights the face and hair with natural glow and soft shadows. The person should be wearing a loose, casual white shirt with slightly rolled-up sleeves. The mood should feel calm, dreamy, and natural, with soft depth of field and a warm, intimate atmosphere.\n\n    **6. Retro Vinyl Lounge Vibe**\n    **Prompt:**\n    Create a hyper-realistic portrait of the uploaded person (preserve face 100%) styled as a 1970s retro icon. He is seated casually in a dimly lit lounge with vintage vinyl records stacked behind him, a glowing jukebox casting warm neon light across the scene. Outfit: open-collared patterned silk shirt, flared trousers, gold chain, and tinted aviator sunglasses. The lighting is warm amber with subtle film grain, evoking the ambience of old Bollywood jazz clubs. Pose is relaxed, with one arm resting on a velvet sofa and a confident half-smile.\n    ",
